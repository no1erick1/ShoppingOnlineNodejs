	title: 'Logitech G19S Gaming Keyboard (Black) ',
	description: "Logitech G19S Gaming Keyboard comes with adjustable , color gamepanel LCD. Extend your cockpit with the G19s GamePanel LCD. Stay informed with real-time game stats, background system information, VoIP communication data, video playback and image slide shows. Add community-developed applets to work with your GamePanel monitor or create your own. Locate keys in any room with custom backlit keys. Choose 1 out of 16 million colors and assign a unique color to each profile, profile mode, and mode style in the same game. You can tell, without looking down, which mode you’re in to ensure your setup is optimized. G19s includes 12 programmable G-keys that simplify complex actions by allowing you to configure up to 36 unique functions across three different modes with three macros per key. With G-keys, instant access to a variety of customizable functions is just a click away. Program G-keys to interact with your mouse to change DPI levels on the fly and instantly switch from lightning-fast speed to pixel-perfect precision. Assign a G-key to open microphone channels and talk to friends through Ventrilo or to record your play on the fly. You can even assign a G-key to send a text broadcast to your team. Harness the power of G-keys to configure single key presses, complex macros or intricate LUA scripts on the fly, and quickly simplify actions to stay immersed in your game and never lose a step. Using infrared technology, we studied the interaction between hand and keyboard, and then added advanced surface materials to strategic zones for improved durability and comfort. A hydrophobic coating helps keep hands from sticking to the palm rest. Double UV coating on the keys provides extra long life durability. In addition, fingerprint-resistant coating on the faceplate helps maintain a fresh look. Details make the difference. The powered USB ports let you transfer data to and from peripherals, like MP3 players and flash drives, while also charging battery-powered devices. Anti-ghosting means every key you press is registered even when you press more than one key at the same time. G19s not only includes anti-ghosting on common multi-key inputs such as control-alt-delete, it includes it over all 26 keys so you can perform multiple complex actions, such as pressing six keys at once, without interference or ghosting. You’re about to record a record high number of perfect headshots when an accidental keystroke sends you on an unplanned, unwanted trip to your desktop. Don’t let this kind of mistake ruin your streak or your game, easily disable the Windows key with one button so your game won’t be interrupted. You can thank us later. You can keep mouse, headset and other cords out of the way by routing them through channels on the underside of G19s. You can upload the latest enhancements developed exclusively for GamePanel by the Logitech open-source community. G19s saves your profiles so you never lose your settings, even when you bring it to other PCs. Convenient one-touch controls give you instant access to volume control and media playback without needing to press a function key. ",
